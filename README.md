# Installation of python libraries for python client

We provide all requirements for the python client within the `requirements.txt` file.
This file was obtained via `pip freeze`, thus one can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` in order to install the requirements.
We highly encourage you to use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io).
